Dear flat seekers,

It's not hopeless. I've searched a flat myself (sent a lot of applications) and yesterday I finally got a "yes". It's a good flat close to the center and I was the lucky one from more than 100 interested people.
What I want to tell you: It's not hopeless!

If you need tips, don't hesitate to ask me.
The homepages where I searched for flats:

- http://www.immobilienscout24.de/ (found mine there)
- http://www.immowelt.de/
- http://www.immonet.de/
- http://www.wg-gesucht.de/
- http://www.immobilienmarkt.de/suchen/Wohnung/mieten
- http://immobilienmarkt.sueddeutsche.de/

To the appointment to view bring a folder with:

- Information sheet (fill in your info): http://www.hellerau-gb.de/mieten/downloads/Mieterselbstauskunft.pdf (for example)
- Schufa / Bonit√§tsauskunft 
- at least the last 3 salary proofs
- proof from your current landlord that you don't have any debts

Older landlords (as they often don't even understand english) prefer to receive German documents from you.
This should improve your chances.

Of course you can ask in this group for flats, but a lot of people are searching a flat themselves. 
Search actively! It's stressful and annoying but that's how it's going.
So the best of luck and don`t give up!
